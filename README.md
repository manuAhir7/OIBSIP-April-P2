# Oasis Internship Task Completion

Introduction

During my Oasis internship, I successfully completed several tasks that allowed me to enhance my skills and knowledge in web development. I am thrilled to share that I have successfully developed and submitted three impressive projects: a Todo website, a Calculator website, and a Tribute page. In this README file, I will provide an overview of each project and highlight some of the key features and technologies used.
Todo Website

The Todo website is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and keep track of their daily activities. This project was aimed at demonstrating my proficiency in front-end development and JavaScript programming.
Key Features

    User-friendly interface: The website offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
    Task Management: Users can easily add, delete, and update tasks, as well as mark tasks as complete.
    Local Storage: The website utilizes browser local storage to persist user tasks even after page refreshes.

Technologies Used

    HTML5/CSS3: The fundamental building blocks for creating the website's structure and styling the user interface.
    JavaScript: Used for implementing the interactive features and managing the task-related functionality.
    Bootstrap: Employed to enhance the website's responsiveness and streamline the design process.

Calculator Website

The Calculator website is a fully functional online calculator that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project aimed to showcase my proficiency in JavaScript programming, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
Key Features

    Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations.
    Keyboard Support: The calculator supports both mouse and keyboard input, providing users with flexibility.
    Error Handling: The website prevents invalid calculations and displays error messages when necessary.

Technologies Used

    JavaScript: Implements the calculator's logic, performs calculations, and handles user interactions.
    Event Handling: Utilized to capture user input and trigger the corresponding calculator functions.

Tribute Page

The Tribute page project involved creating a webpage that pays tribute to a notable individual or subject of choice. I selected a remarkable figure from history and developed a visually engaging and informative page to honor their achievements.

    Responsive Design: Ensures optimal display across various devices and screen sizes.
    Content Presentation: Utilized appropriate HTML tags to organize and present the tribute information effectively.

Conclusion

Completing the Oasis internship tasks has been an enriching experience that allowed me to apply and refine my web development skills. The Todo website, Calculator website, and Tribute page exemplify my capabilities in front-end development, JavaScript programming, and design principles. I am excited to have had the opportunity to showcase these projects and I look forward to continuing my journey as a web developer.
